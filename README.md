# Kickstarter-Challenge
## Overview of Project
Louise is a playwrite who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign for her new play fever and we have been given kickstarter data of past crowdfunding campaigns.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Louise by analyzing the data to see what metrics or factors can affect the success of the crowdfunding campaign so she can ensure her campaign is successful.
## Analysis and Challenges
I analyzed the data based by focusing on two areas that could affect the success of the campaign. The first was looking at how the launch date affected the success and then looking at how the amount of the goal affected the success of the campaign.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
As Louise is interested in knowing if her crowdfunding campaign for a play would be successful, I filtered the data for by parent category of "theater" and analyzed to see if there is a correlation between the launch date of the campaign and the success of it. The launch date has been divided by months and I used a line chart to demonstrate the correlation showing the successful, canceled & failed play campaigns on the Y axis and the Launch date months on the X axis. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69806770/91567983-45a03880-e913-11ea-85e6-66dd291b0c29.png)  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The next category I analyzed was the correlation between the success of the campaign and the range of the goal that was set for the campaign. Firstly, I divided the goals into ranges i.e less than 1000. Then using the COUNTIFS formula, I gathered the number of successful, Canceled and failed plays in each goal range. I then changed the data form to a percentage of successful, failed and canceled and presented it in a line chart: ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69806770/91600175-80b36380-e935-11ea-92f4-24eb71389f31.png)
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not have any difficulties analyzing the data. However, as this is a large data file with many categories and data points, a challenge I can forsee is finding out which parts of the data are helpful for getting to our ultimate purpose which is to help Louise find out the metrics that could impact the success of her campaign. Also, since we are working off of different sheets on excel and creating formulas going back and forth between the sheets, can pose an error if not done correctly.
## Results
- The most successful theater campaigns took place in between the months of April and August which tells us this is the best time for Louise to launch her campaign. The month of December which is the end of the year, is the least successful time to launch a crowdfunding campaign. Also, the results show that there are very few canceled theater campaigns throughout the year which is a positive sign. 
- There is not a huge correlation between the outcome of the campaigns and the range of the goals however the table shows that the highest campaign goals and lowest campaign goals had the most number of successful campaigns versus the middle range that was not as successful and had more failed campaigns. 
- A limitation of this data set, is that the data captured and the launch dates are from various years and there could have been more successful campaign years versus others that can affect the average donation and the success of the campaign. 
- Some other graphs and charts that can be used are a box and whisker plot to identify any outliers in the data and also doing a regression analysis on the outcomes vs launch date data to confirm that the data set is good and there is variability.
