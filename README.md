# Kickstarter-Challenge
## Overview of Project
Louise is a playwrite who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign for her new play fever and we have been given kickstarter data of past crowdfunding campaigns.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Louise by analyzing the data to see what metrics or factors can affect the success of the crowdfunding campaign so she can ensure her campaign is successful.
## Analysis and Challenges
I analyzed the data based by focusing on two areas that could affect the success of the campaign. The first was looking at how the launch date affected the success and then looking at how the amount of the goal affected the success of the campaign.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
As Louise is interested in knowing if her crowdfunding campaign for a play would be successful, I filtered the data for plays and analyzed to see if there is a correlation between the launch date of the campaign and the success of it. The launch date has been divided by months and I used a line chart to demonstrate the correlation showing the successful, canceled & failed play campaigns on the Y axis and the Launch date months on the X axis.
